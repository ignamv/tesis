The reader, who deals with Floating Gate memory devices at different levels - from test-structures to complex circuit design - will find an essential explanation on device physics and technology, and also circuit issues which must be fully understood while developing a new device. Device engineers will use this book to find simplified models to design new process steps or new architectures. Circuit designers will find the basic theory to understand the use of compact models to validate circuits against process variations and to evaluate the impact of parameter variations on circuit performances. Floating Gate Devices: Operation and Compact Modeling is meant to be a basic tool for designing the next generation of memory devices based on FG technologies.},

	abstract = {A novel Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor ({MAPS}) for charged particle tracking made in a standard {CMOS} technology is proposed. The sensor is a photodiode, which is readily available in a {CMOS} technology. The diode has a special structure, which allows the high detection efficiency required for tracking applications. The partially depleted thin epitaxial silicon layer is used as a sensitive detector volume. Semiconductor device simulation, using either {ToSCA} based or 3-D {ISE}-{TCAD} software packages shows that the charge collection is efficient, reasonably fast (order of 100 ns), and the charge spreading limited to a few pixels only. A first prototype has been designed, fabricated and tested. It is made of four arrays each containing 64×64 pixels, with a readout pitch of 20 μm in both directions. The device is fabricated using standard submicron 0.6 μm {CMOS} process, which features twin-tub implanted in a p-type epitaxial layer, a characteristic common to many modern {CMOS} {VLSI} processes. Extensive tests made with soft X-ray source (55Fe) and minimum ionising particles (15 {GeV}/c pions) fully demonstrate the predicted performances, with the individual pixel noise ({ENC}) below 20 electrons and the Signal-to-Noise ratio for both 5.9 {keV} X-rays and Minimum Ionising Particles ({MIP}) of the order of 30. This novel device opens new perspectives in high-precision vertex detectors in Particle Physics experiments, as well as in other application, like low-energy beta particle imaging, visible light single photon imaging (using the Hybrid Photon Detector approach) and high-precision slow neutron imaging.},

The dosimeter output is the reference transistor gate bias required to give the same drain current in the sensor and reference {MOSFETs} at the same drain-source bias. Sensitivities up to 3 {mV}/rad have been achieved. The dosimeter provides excellent first-order temperature compensation. With second-order temperature compensation using an external temperature sensor, doses less than 500 mrad should be resolvable.},

After irradiation, low {VTH} tails appear in {VTH} distributions, growing with ion linear energy transfer ({LET}) and fluence. In particular, high {LET} ions, such as iodine used in this paper, can produce a bit flip. Since the existing models cannot account for large charge losses from the floating gate, we propose a new mechanism, based on the excess of positive charge produced by a single ion, temporarily lowering the tunnel oxide barrier (positive charge assisted leakage current) and enhancing the tunneling current. This mechanism fully explains the experimental data we present},

	abstract = {Electronic conduction in thermally grown {SiO}2 has been shown to be limited by Fowler-Nordheim emission, i.e., tunneling of electrons from the vicinity of the {electrodeFermi} level through the forbidden energy gap into the conduction band of the oxide. Fowler-Nordheim characteristics have been observed over more than five decades of current for emission from Si, Al, and Mg. If previously measured values of the barrier heights are used, the slopes of the Fowler-Nordheim characteristics (log J/E 2 vs 1/E) imply values of the relative effective mass in the forbidden band of about 0.4. These values take into account corrections for image-force barrier lowering and for temperature effects. The absolute values of the currents are lower by a factor of five to ten than the theoretically expected values, probably due to trapping effects. The temperature dependence of the current was found to follow the theoretical curve from 80°–420°K. However, an inconsistent relative effective mass of about 0.95 had to be assumed. These results are believed to provide the most complete examination of the Fowler-Nordheim-emission theory.},

    abstract = {In image-guided radiation therapy ({IGRT}), volumetric information on patient anatomy at treatment conditions is made available with in-room imaging devices capable of cone-beam {CT}. Setup error and inter-fraction rigid motion can be corrected online. The planning margin can therefore be reduced significantly. However, to compensate for uncertainties including organ deformation and intra-fraction motion, offline evaluation and replanning are necessary. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of an offline dose compensation technique to further reduce the margin safely. In {IGRT}, online {CT} scan, rigid image registration and setup correction are performed at each fraction. Later the regions of interest are registered offline between treatment and planning {CTs} using a finite element method to account for non-rigid organ motion. Cumulative dose distribution is calculated and compared with the prescription dose. The discrepancy, if found significant, is repaired using the dose compensation technique, in which the cumulative dose distribution is incorporated in adaptive {IMRT} planning for future fractions. Two compensation schedules were tested in this study: single compensation at the end of the treatment course and compensation performed weekly. One patient with one planning {CT} and 16 treatment {CTs} were used in this simulation study. Due to the aggressive smaller planning margin used, severe underdose was observed in the clinical target volume. The size and magnitude of the underdose were reduced substantially with online guidance but were still significant. Both dose compensation strategies were able to reduce the dose deficit to an acceptable level without additional planning margin. Weekly compensation is more biologically beneficial and can spread the execution error into multiple fractions. The offline dose compensation technique allows further margin reduction and can complement the online guidance by compensating for uncertainties that cannot be reduced online, thereby increasing the confidence in {IGRT} delivery.},

The dosimeter consists of two pairs of floating-gate sensor transistors with identical geometry for compensation purpose, {VTH} (threshold voltage) extractor circuits and substractors. The dosimeter output presents the threshold voltage changes of the floating-gate {MOSFET} sensors before and after radiation. The circuit has been modeled and simulated in Hspice using {TSMC} 0.35μm {CMOS} technology at 2.4V power supply. Simulated results show a low sensitivity to temperature and {VDD} variations and a low power consumption of 0.44mW.},

	abstract = {Nonepitaxial, high resistivity silicon has been used as a substrate for implementation of {CMOS} monolithic active pixel sensors ({MAPS}) designed for high precision minimum ionizing particle tracking. The readout electronics circuitry is integrated directly on top of such a substrate using a standard commercial {CMOS} process. In this paper, measurements of these devices using a high-energy particle beam are presented. Efficient and performing {MIP} tracking is demonstrated for both small (20 μm) and large (40 μm) pixel readout pitch. Radiation hardness that satisfies many future particle physics applications is also proven. These results show that the use of epitaxial substrate for {MAPS} fabrication is not mandatory, opening a much larger choice of possible {CMOS} processes in the future.},

Sensitivity is maximized by not overlapping the floating gate with a control gate. The floating gate is precharged prior to irradiation by tunneling. No bias is applied during irradiation. The dosimeter output is the reference transistor gate bias required to give the same drain current in the sensor and reference {MOSFETs} at the same drain-source bias. Sensitivities up to 3 {mV}/rad have been achieved. The dosimeter provides excellent first-order temperature compensation. With second-order temperature compensation using an external temperature sensor, doses less than 500 mrad should be resolvable.},
