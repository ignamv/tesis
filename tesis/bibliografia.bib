The reader, who deals with Floating Gate memory devices at different levels - from test-structures to complex circuit design - will find an essential explanation on device physics and technology, and also circuit issues which must be fully understood while developing a new device. Device engineers will use this book to find simplified models to design new process steps or new architectures. Circuit designers will find the basic theory to understand the use of compact models to validate circuits against process variations and to evaluate the impact of parameter variations on circuit performances. Floating Gate Devices: Operation and Compact Modeling is meant to be a basic tool for designing the next generation of memory devices based on FG technologies.},

	abstract = {A novel Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor ({MAPS}) for charged particle tracking made in a standard {CMOS} technology is proposed. The sensor is a photodiode, which is readily available in a {CMOS} technology. The diode has a special structure, which allows the high detection efficiency required for tracking applications. The partially depleted thin epitaxial silicon layer is used as a sensitive detector volume. Semiconductor device simulation, using either {ToSCA} based or 3-D {ISE}-{TCAD} software packages shows that the charge collection is efficient, reasonably fast (order of 100 ns), and the charge spreading limited to a few pixels only. A first prototype has been designed, fabricated and tested. It is made of four arrays each containing 64×64 pixels, with a readout pitch of 20 μm in both directions. The device is fabricated using standard submicron 0.6 μm {CMOS} process, which features twin-tub implanted in a p-type epitaxial layer, a characteristic common to many modern {CMOS} {VLSI} processes. Extensive tests made with soft X-ray source (55Fe) and minimum ionising particles (15 {GeV}/c pions) fully demonstrate the predicted performances, with the individual pixel noise ({ENC}) below 20 electrons and the Signal-to-Noise ratio for both 5.9 {keV} X-rays and Minimum Ionising Particles ({MIP}) of the order of 30. This novel device opens new perspectives in high-precision vertex detectors in Particle Physics experiments, as well as in other application, like low-energy beta particle imaging, visible light single photon imaging (using the Hybrid Photon Detector approach) and high-precision slow neutron imaging.},

The dosimeter output is the reference transistor gate bias required to give the same drain current in the sensor and reference {MOSFETs} at the same drain-source bias. Sensitivities up to 3 {mV}/rad have been achieved. The dosimeter provides excellent first-order temperature compensation. With second-order temperature compensation using an external temperature sensor, doses less than 500 mrad should be resolvable.},

After irradiation, low {VTH} tails appear in {VTH} distributions, growing with ion linear energy transfer ({LET}) and fluence. In particular, high {LET} ions, such as iodine used in this paper, can produce a bit flip. Since the existing models cannot account for large charge losses from the floating gate, we propose a new mechanism, based on the excess of positive charge produced by a single ion, temporarily lowering the tunnel oxide barrier (positive charge assisted leakage current) and enhancing the tunneling current. This mechanism fully explains the experimental data we present},

	abstract = {Electronic conduction in thermally grown {SiO}2 has been shown to be limited by Fowler-Nordheim emission, i.e., tunneling of electrons from the vicinity of the {electrodeFermi} level through the forbidden energy gap into the conduction band of the oxide. Fowler-Nordheim characteristics have been observed over more than five decades of current for emission from Si, Al, and Mg. If previously measured values of the barrier heights are used, the slopes of the Fowler-Nordheim characteristics (log J/E 2 vs 1/E) imply values of the relative effective mass in the forbidden band of about 0.4. These values take into account corrections for image-force barrier lowering and for temperature effects. The absolute values of the currents are lower by a factor of five to ten than the theoretically expected values, probably due to trapping effects. The temperature dependence of the current was found to follow the theoretical curve from 80°–420°K. However, an inconsistent relative effective mass of about 0.95 had to be assumed. These results are believed to provide the most complete examination of the Fowler-Nordheim-emission theory.},

    abstract = {In image-guided radiation therapy ({IGRT}), volumetric information on patient anatomy at treatment conditions is made available with in-room imaging devices capable of cone-beam {CT}. Setup error and inter-fraction rigid motion can be corrected online. The planning margin can therefore be reduced significantly. However, to compensate for uncertainties including organ deformation and intra-fraction motion, offline evaluation and replanning are necessary. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of an offline dose compensation technique to further reduce the margin safely. In {IGRT}, online {CT} scan, rigid image registration and setup correction are performed at each fraction. Later the regions of interest are registered offline between treatment and planning {CTs} using a finite element method to account for non-rigid organ motion. Cumulative dose distribution is calculated and compared with the prescription dose. The discrepancy, if found significant, is repaired using the dose compensation technique, in which the cumulative dose distribution is incorporated in adaptive {IMRT} planning for future fractions. Two compensation schedules were tested in this study: single compensation at the end of the treatment course and compensation performed weekly. One patient with one planning {CT} and 16 treatment {CTs} were used in this simulation study. Due to the aggressive smaller planning margin used, severe underdose was observed in the clinical target volume. The size and magnitude of the underdose were reduced substantially with online guidance but were still significant. Both dose compensation strategies were able to reduce the dose deficit to an acceptable level without additional planning margin. Weekly compensation is more biologically beneficial and can spread the execution error into multiple fractions. The offline dose compensation technique allows further margin reduction and can complement the online guidance by compensating for uncertainties that cannot be reduced online, thereby increasing the confidence in {IGRT} delivery.},

A systematic error of 2.2\% on the mean value was shown to be due to a systematic deficiency in the algorithm used in the planning system and to a systematic error in the application of the dosimetry protocol. Two treatment techniques were identified leading to an erroneous dose delivery. Finally, large deviations (more than 2 S.D.) of the measured dose from the expected dose were detected in 3\% of the measured treatment set-ups, the sources of the errors could in all cases be identified and eliminated in the further treatment sessions.

	abstract = {The commercially available {microMOSFET} dosimeter was characterized for its dosimetric properties in radiotherapy treatments. The {MOSFET} exhibited excellent correlation with the dose and was linear in the range of 5–500 {cGy}. No measurable effect in response was observed in the temperature range of 20–40 °C. No significant change in response was observed by changing the dose rate between 100 and 600 monitor units ({MU}) min −1 or change in the dose per pulse. A 3\% post-irradiation fading was observed within the first 5 h of exposure and thereafter it remained stable up to 60 h. A uniform energy response was observed in the therapy range between 4 {MV} and 18 {MV}. However, below 0.6 {MeV} (Cs-132), the {MOSFET} response increased with the decrease in energy. The {MOSFET} also had a uniform dose response in 6–20 {MeV} electron beams. The directional dependence of {MOSFET} was within ±2\% for all the energies studied. The inherent build-up of the {MOSFET} was evaluated dosimetrically and found to have varying water equivalent thickness, depending on the energy and the side of the beam entry. At depth, a single calibration factor obtained by averaging the {MOSFET} response over different field sizes, energies, orientation and depths reproduced the ion chamber measured dose to within 5\%. The stereotactic and the penumbral measurements demonstrated that the {MOSFET} could be used in a high gradient field such as {IMRT}. The study showed that the {microMOSFET} dosimeter could be used as an in vivo dosimeter to verify the dose delivery to the patient to within ±5\%.},

For each patient the target-absorbed dose is derived from the entrance and exit doses measured by silicon diodes, on the beam axis at the patient's skin. Depending on the discrepancies observed between the measured and expected doses we have set decision levels for the corrective actions to be taken. In addition these measurements allow us to obtain information on the overall accuracy or on the quality of a specific treatment. During 5 years, 7519 patients have been measured and 79 errors were detected. Half could have induced a variation of over 10\% in the dose delivered. Seventy-eight out of 79 errors were of human origin. As part of an overall quality assurance programme, it is of the utmost importance to check the dose delivered for each patient undergoing radiotherapy treatment in order to avoid systematic underdosing or overdosing.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0360-3016(98)00341-1},
	abstract = {In this critical review of the current practice of patient dose verification, we first demonstrate that a high accuracy (about 1–2\%, 1 {SD}) can be obtained. Accurate in vivo dosimetry is possible if diodes and thermoluminescence dosimeters ({TLDs}), the main detector types in use for in vivo dosimetry, are carefully calibrated and the factors influencing their sensitivity are taken into account. Various methods and philosophies for applying patient dose verification are then evaluated: the measurement of each field for each fraction of each patient, a limited number of checks for all patients, or measurements of specific patient groups, for example, during total body irradiation ({TBI}) or conformal radiotherapy. The experience of a number of centers is then presented,providing information on the various types of errors detected by in vivo dosimetry, including their frequency and magnitude. From the results of recent studies it can be concluded that in centers having modern equipment with verification systems as well as comprehensive quality assurance ({QA}) programs, a systematic error larger than 5\% in dose delivery is still present for 0.5–1\% of the patient treatments. In other studies, a frequency of 3–10\% of errors was observed for specific patient groups or when no verification system was present at the accelerator. These results were balanced against the additional manpower and other resources required for such a {QA} program. It could be concluded that patient dose verification should be an essential part of a {QA} program in a radiotherapy department, and plays a complementary role to treatment-sheet double checking. As the radiotherapy community makes the transition from the conventional two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) conformal and intensity modulated dose delivery, it is recommended that new treatment techniques be checked systematically for a few patients, and to perform in vivo dosimetry a few times for each patient for situations where errors in dose delivery should be minimized.},

	abstract = {Ionizing radiation has been found to be widely applicable in modifying the structure and properties of polymers, and can be used to tailor the performance of either bulk materials or surfaces. Fifty years of research in polymer radiation chemistry has led to numerous applications of commercial and economic importance, and work remains active in the application of radiation to practical uses involving polymeric materials. This paper provides a survey of radiation-processing methods of industrial interest, ranging from technologies already commercially well established, through innovations in the active R\&D stage which show exceptional promise for future commercial use. Radiation-processing technologies are discussed under the following categories: cross-linking of plastics and rubbers, curing of coatings and inks, heat-shrink products, fiber–matrix composites, chain-scission for processing control, surface modification, grafting, hydrogels, sterilization, natural product enhancement, plastics recycling, ceramic precursors, electronic property materials, ion-track membranes and lithography for microdevice production. In addition to new technological innovations utilizing conventional gamma and e-beam sources, a number of promising new applications make use of novel radiation types which include ion beams (heavy ions, light ions, highly focused microscopic beams and high-intensity pulses), soft X-rays which are focused, coherent X-rays (from a synchrotron) and e-beams which undergo scattering to generate patterns.},

	abstract = {Ideal for upper-level undergraduate or first-year graduate courses and as a handy reference for professionals, The Science and Engineering of Microelectronic Fabrication, Second Edition, provides a thorough and accessible introduction to the field of microfabrication. Revised and expanded in this second edition, the text covers all the basic unit processes used to fabricate integrated circuits, including photolithography, plasma and reactive ion etching, ion implantation, diffusion, oxidation, evaporation, vapor phase epitaxial growth, sputtering, and chemical vapor deposition. Advanced processing topics such as rapid thermal processing, next generation lithography, molecular beam epitaxy, and metal organic chemical vapor deposition are also presented. The physics and chemistry of each process is introduced along with descriptions of the equipment used for the manufacture of integrated circuits. The text also discusses the integration of these processes into common technologies such as {CMOS}, double poly bipolar, and {GaAs} {MESFETs}. Complexity/performance tradeoffs are evaluated along with a description of current state-of-the-art devices. Each chapter includes sample problems with solutions. The text makes use of the popular process simulation package {SUPREM} to provide more meaningful examples of the type of real-world dopant redistribution problems that microelectronic fabrication engineers must face.  This new edition includes a chapter on microelectromechanical structures ({MEMS}), an exciting new area in microfabrication. The coverage of {MEMS} includes fundamentals of mechanics; stress in thin films; mechanical to electrical transduction; mechanics of common {MEMS} devices; bulk micromachining etching techniques; bulk micromachining process flow; surface micromachining basics; surface micromachining process flow; {MEMS} actuators; and high aspect ratio microsystems technology ({HARMST}).},

The authors present a novel approach to perform online monitoring of the staff during their interventions by using a device based on an Active Pixel Sensor. The performance of the sensor as an X-ray radiation detector has been evaluated with a proper experimental setup: the number of photons and the generated charge have been assessed as dosimetric observables from the frames acquired by the sensor using a two-threshold clustering algorithm, the efficiency of which has been evaluated as well. The correlation of these observables with passive dosimeter dose measurements has been analyzed: a good linearity has been demonstrated, and the response difference between pulsed and continuous operational modes is reduced to less than 10\%, marking a distinct improvement with respect to commercial Active Personal Dosimeters.},
